  <h1><b>STORE</b></h1>
</div>
<div class="store-contente">
The Store is a place where agents and cosmetics can be bought. It contains three types; a Featured store containing featured cosmetic bundles and daily weapon skin offers, an Agent store containing the game's agents, and an Accessory store containing weekly offers for accessories from previous battle passes.

  <h1><b>Featured Store</b></h1>
</div>
<div class="store-contente">
The Featured store is the Store's main section, primarily focusing on weapon skins. When a new bundle is released, it becomes available in the Featured store for a limited time. Usually there is only a single featured bundle available, but occasionally two bundles may be available at once.

Welcome current and aspiring VALORANT players, my name is Joe Lee and I’m the revenue lead for the game. Through the closed beta or elsewhere, you’ve probably already seen the work-in-progress VALORANT store and a small sample of the weapon skins and other cosmetic content available.<br><br>

The Premium Content team and I hope you’ll be able to collect and customize your VALORANT experience into one that champions your playstyle, performance, or maybe just your taste in shiny weapons.<br><br>

<b>First and foremost: we care about making a great game.</b> The collection of optional extras will never affect gameplay, so all you need to focus on is hitting your shots and going B, but then going A. Or going A, but going A.<br><br>

Below, I’ll dive deeper into cosmetic content and how to get them. Here’s your quick summary:<br>
<ul>
<li>Unlock new Agents, weapon skins, player cards, and sprays by completing Agent Contracts</li>
<li>Unlock weapon skins in the Store by using VALORANT Points</li>
<li>“Evolve” certain weapon skins and go deeper on a theme by spending Radianite Points</li>
<li>Earn items in the Battle Pass (available at launch) on the free and paid track</li>
</ul>
