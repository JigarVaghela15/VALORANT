    <h1><b>BATTLE PASS</b></h1>
  </div>
The Battle Pass is a <b>cosmetic</b> system in <b>VALORANT</b> that allows players to unlock a variety of cosmetics as they earn experience through missions and match <b>XP.</b><br/><br/>

Each <b>act</b> has its own pass, and every new act closes progress on the current pass and resetting all players back to the beginning of the new pass. All players can unlock cosmetics rewards from the act pass, but most of that pass' content can only be unlocked by paying Valorant Points1,000 to get access to the Premium track.<br/><br/>

Occasionally, additional passes are released within an act to celebrate an occasion, such as VALORANT's anniversaries.<br/>
<br/>

Every act, a new act Battle Pass is launched that lasts for the duration of the act (about two months). Each act pass has 55 tiers grouped into 11 chapters; chapters 1-10 and a final Epilogue chapter, with 5 tiers in every chapter. Players start with Tier 1 completed. The amount of XP required to complete Tier 2 is 2,000, and for every tier after that (except for Epilogue Tiers), the amount of XP required to complete that tier increases by 750:<br/><br/>

<b>XP to complete a specific tier =(Tier Number Ã— 750)+500</b><br/><br/>

Each Epilogue tier requires 36,500 XP. This means the total amount of XP required to complete the pass is 1,162,500 XP, and 980,000 XP is required to reach Chapter 10/Tier 50.<br/><br/>

There are two tracks in the act pass; Free and Premium. The free track gives all players rewards with every chapter they complete, as well as access to all Epilogue rewards. The Premium track, which costs Valorant Points1,000 to get access to, boosts Battle Pass XP gains from playing matchmade games (mission XP excluded) by 3% and gives these players additional rewards for every tier they complete. Players earn progress for tiers regardless of whether they have bought access to the Premium track or not. This means players can buy access to the Premium track weeks after the act begins to retroactively unlock the rewards they earned while on the free track. The 3% XP boost however is not applied retroactively and only takes effect for every game played after the player unlocked the Premium track. Premium track players can also automatically earn progress to reach a specific tier they haven't unlocked by paying Valorant Points300 for every tier that needs to be completed to reach the player's target. This cannot be used for Epilogue tiers.<br/><br/>

Act passes contain weapon skins, accessories (player cards, gunbuddies, sprays, player titles), and Radianite Points. The amount of each type of cosmetic in this pass can vary, but for the free track it is always the same:<br/><br/>
<div class="battle-list">
<ul><b>Tiers 1-50</b>
<li>3 player cards</li>
<li>3 gunbuddies</li>
<li>3 player titles</li>
<li>2 sprays</li>
<li>3 lots of Radianite Points 10 (excluding Episode 01: IGNITION: Act 2, which had 2 lots of Radianite Points 10)</li>
<li>1 sidearm skin</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="battle-list">
<ul><b>Epilogue</b>
<li>1 player card</li>
<li>1 gunbuddy or spray</li>
<li>3 lots of Radianite Points 10</li>
</ul>
</div>
Players with access to the Premium track will earn additional cosmetics and RP, with the exception of player titles (all Act Pass player titles are part of the free track). These include access to three new collections of weapon skins, two of which will be Select Select Edition and one of which will be Deluxe Deluxe Edition. The Tier 50 reward for Premium Track owners will always be a knife skin, one of the most "valuable" types of weapon skins in the game. The Epilogue chapter also has set rewards; golden variants of two rewards from this pass (cosmetics eligible for golden variants are cards, gunbuddies, and sprays), unlocked at tiers 1 and 5, and three lots of Radianite Points 10, unlocked at tiers 2, 3, and 4.<br/><br/>

When a new act arrives, a new pass with new content begins and the previous pass becomes unavailable, with its weapon skins no longer being able to be obtained by any means. Once an act battle pass is no longer one of the three most recent passes to have been released, its accessory content will become eligible to appear in a player's weekly Offers in their Accessory Store, where players can unlock past items using Kingdom Credits.
